Hi there, this is the first blog from Battle Koi.

I've migrated the Battle Koi website to use `eleventy` instead of `React`. I was having trouble maintaining the previous site since I hadn't touched `React` for over a year. Having to keep updated with web development libraries became a massive chore when I just wanted to focus on making games.

I've also decided to start blogging my games and development. I figured it would be a good way to look back in a few months/years to see what I came up with. Anyway, we'll see where it goes. I hope you'll follow along for the ride.
